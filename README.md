# OKCoders-HW-Repo

Welcome to my Homework Repo. This is where I will post proof of completion of homework assignments via images. Initially I will posted completed sections of the Free Code Camp courses and will update with a completion certificate to consolidate the images and reduce the clutter of this section. Once I have completed the OKCoders course, I will update this Repo to focus on my overall coding education and experience in an organized manner.<br><br>
